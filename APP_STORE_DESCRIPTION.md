ZapSplit makes splitting bills effortless. Whether you're out for dinner, sharing rent, or splitting a group trip, ZapSplit handles the maths so you don't have to.

SCAN RECEIPTS WITH AI
Take a photo of any receipt and our AI will automatically extract every item and price. Assign items to the right people for a perfectly fair split — no more guessing who had what.

SPLIT ANY WAY YOU WANT
Choose from equal splits, custom amounts, or item-by-item receipt splits. ZapSplit adapts to however your group wants to divide expenses.

SHARE A LINK, GET PAID
Generate a payment link and send it via text, WhatsApp, or any messaging app. Friends can pay directly through the link — they don't even need to download the app.

INCLUDE ANYONE
Add people who don't have ZapSplit to your splits. Enter their name, share the payment link, and they can pay instantly through the web. No sign-up required for them.

TRACK EVERYTHING
See who has paid and who still owes at a glance. Get real-time updates when payments come in. Never wonder where you stand.

SECURE PAYMENTS
All payments are processed through Stripe, a globally trusted payment platform. Your card details are never stored on our servers. Apple Pay and Google Pay supported.

## Review Notes for Apple
"ZapSplit requires a network connection to function. The app uses Stripe for payment processing (test mode credentials are configured for review). Receipt scanning requires camera or photo library access to capture receipts. Push notifications are used to alert users about payment activity."
